# python-api-challenge
Resources: Max and I worked on this homework together, as usual. 
Vacation:
I got the first plot from the class work on juptyer notebook.
For .copy() I used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/123198/how-to-copy-files
Then for the lingress part I used some of the work from class and watched a couple youtube videos over it. https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.linregress.html
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25289122/scipy-linregress-computing-only-scaling-slope-parameter-with-intercept-fixed-at
All in all I didn't use a ton of online resources for this part, mostly just trial and error.

Weather:
For creating the url I used the class work that we did and rewatched a lot of class. Then it was basically trial and error until I found what worked. 
The for the scatter plots I used the documentation: https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html
And a little stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10336614/scatter-plot-in-matplotlib

All in all I would say I used the least amount of outside resources for this challenge compared to others.
